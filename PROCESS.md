## Session Log

### 2026-05-20 — Session 1 (Phase 0 scaffolding)

**Commit:** `d687eaf` — `chore: scaffold ligala-v2 monorepo (Phase 0)` (85 files)

- **Did:**
  - Initialized git repo (main branch) at `C:\Users\dejes\munus\ligala\ligala-v2`
  - Created full monorepo directory tree
  - Wrote root config files (pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json, .gitignore, .editorconfig, .nvmrc, .env.example)
  - Wrote app skeletons: Next.js 15 (`apps/web`) with route groups for (client)(lawyer)(admin)(marketing) and `/api/health`; Hono (`apps/api`) with `/health` and per-domain route stubs.
  - Wrote package skeletons: `@ligala/db` (Drizzle config + empty schema), `@ligala/auth` (Better Auth config), `@ligala/ui` (shadcn entry), `@ligala/shared` (Zod schemas + errors), `@ligala/email` (React Email).
  - Wrote CDK infra skeleton: `CoreStack` (VPC + Aurora + Redis + S3 + SES stubs) and `AppStack` (API Lambda + workers + SQS + EventBridge stubs).
  - Wrote workers skeleton (paymongo, paypal, idmeta, email, image handlers).
  - Wrote GitHub Actions CI workflow.
- **Did NOT:**
  - `pnpm install` (deferred — explicit step for dev to run after review)
  - Sentry DSN wiring (waiting on org Sentry project creation)
  - CDK `synth` / `deploy` (waiting on AWS creds + dev account)
  - Drizzle schema beyond Better Auth tables (each phase adds its own aggregates)
- **Decisions made:** captured in Decisions Log below.
- **Open questions:** none at scaffold level.

## Decisions Log

*Append-only. Each decision: date, what, why, revisit-when.*

- **2026-05-20 — Stack frozen at plan-approval time.** Next.js 15 + Hono + Aurora Serverless v2 Postgres + Drizzle + Better Auth + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + CDK + GitHub Actions + Sentry + SES. Why: see `docs/` plan. Revisit: never as a bundle — only individual swaps with justification.
- **2026-05-20 — Single Next.js app, role-based route groups.** `(client)`, `(lawyer)`, `(admin)`, `(marketing)`. Why: smallest infra surface; role gating in middleware. Revisit: if admin compliance posture diverges (Phase 7+).
- **2026-05-20 — Drop from v1: Auth0, Azure MSAL, Builder.io, Web3, 3-mode API switcher, per-endpoint Lambdas, dual KYC components.** Why: see plan rationale.
- **2026-05-20 — Day-one integrations: PayMongo, PayPal, IDMeta KYC, Google Maps, CD Asia.** Why: confirmed during planning.
- **2026-05-20 — Sign-in methods at launch: email/password + Google OAuth only.** Microsoft OAuth and magic-link deferred to Phase 7+.
- **2026-05-20 — Sharp in dedicated Lambda layer (carry pattern from v1).** Why: avoids Next.js Image runtime cost for the high-volume KYC upload path.
- **2026-05-20 — `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` in `tsconfig.base.json`.** Why: forces explicit `import type` everywhere, which Drizzle and Next.js Server Actions are picky about.
- **2026-05-20 — Pinned zod to `^4.0.0` repo-wide and Hono to `^4.10.0` / `@hono/zod-validator` to `^0.8.0`.** Why: Better Auth's `better-call` requires zod v4, and `@hono/zod-validator@0.8` is the first version with dual zod v3/v4 peer support. Resolves peer-dep warning from initial install. **Migration impact:** `z.string().url()` and `z.string().email()` are deprecated in zod 4 (still work); prefer `z.url()` / `z.email()` in new schemas.

---

## Deferred Items

*Tracked, not forgotten. Each: what, why deferred, when to revisit.*

- **Microsoft OAuth in Better Auth** — Deferred to Phase 7+. Revisit if law-firm pilots ask for it.
- **Magic-link auth** — Deferred to Phase 7+. Revisit if password-reset volume becomes painful.
- **Next.js hosting choice: Amplify vs SST/Lambda** — Defaulting to Amplify in Phase 0. Revisit at Phase 8 if RSC streaming behavior is unsatisfactory.
- **Aurora min-ACU tuning** — Starting at 0.5 dev / 1.0 prod. Revisit after Phase 8 load test.
- **Microsoft 365 SSO for law firms** — Not on roadmap; revisit if a paid firm asks.
- **Builder.io CMS replacement** — Marketing pages will be MDX inside `app/(marketing)`. Revisit if non-devs need to edit content regularly.
- **PayMongo + PayPal abstraction layer** — Per-provider implementations in Phase 5; refactor to a `PaymentProvider` interface only if/when a third provider lands.

## Maintenance Rule

Every PR that completes a phase milestone must:
1. Update **Current State** (active phase, last session, env status, next action).
2. Tick the **Phase Tracker** box with the commit SHA.
3. Append a **Session Log** entry (Did / Did NOT / Decisions / Open Questions).
4. Append to **Decisions Log** or **Deferred Items** if applicable.

Phase Tracker boxes are checked **only after** the deployed-env smoke test passes — not just local green.
